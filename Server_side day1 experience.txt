As we already learnt python object oriented programming concepts in the first year, it is easy to write the code for today's assignment. The sequence of steps given in the assignment helped me to solve the problem even quickly and made it easier.  This assignment and today's concepts helped me to brush up all the concepts of python and object oriented programming.
